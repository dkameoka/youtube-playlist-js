# YouTube Console Javascript
Javascript to use in a browser console that bulk adds and deletes videos from YouTube playlists

## Usage

1. Open console in a browser.
2. Copy script contents (from a text editor) and paste it into the console and press enter.

* I recommend testing it out on a few videos in an empty playlist, because YouTube could change at any time.
* youtube-playlist-add-all.js: Run this script to automatically add available videos that could be manually added from the page. Can be run from various YouTube pages.
* youtube-playlist-remove.js: Run this script to automatically remove videos from a personal playlist. Must be on the playlist's page.
